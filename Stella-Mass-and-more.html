<p>Black holes of stellar mass are expected to form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed, it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. By absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes, supermassive black holes of millions of solar masses may form. There is general consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centers of most galaxies.</p>

<p>Despite its invisible interior, the presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other matter and with electromagnetic radiation such as visible light. Matter that falls onto a black hole can form an external accretion disk heated by friction, forming some of the brightest objects in the universe. If there are other stars orbiting a black hole, their orbits can be used to determine the black hole's mass and location. Such observations can be used to exclude possible alternatives such as neutron stars. In this way, astronomers have identified numerous stellar black hole candidates in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_star">binary systems</a>, and established that the radio source known as <i lang="eng">Sagittarius</i>, at the core of our own Milky Way galaxy, contains a supermassive black hole of about 4.3 million solar masses.</p>

<p>On <time datetime="2016-02-11">11 February 2016</time>, the <abbr title="Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory">LIGO</abbr> collaboration announced the first observation of gravitational waves; because these waves were generated from a black hole merger it was the first ever direct detection of a binary black hole merger. On <time datetime="2016-06-15">15 June 2016</time>, a second detection of a gravitational wave event from colliding black holes was announced by the <cite class="magazine">The New York Times</cite>.</p>
