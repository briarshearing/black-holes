<p>Objects whose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field">gravitational fields </a>are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by <i class="person">John Michell</i> and <i class="person">Pierre-Simon Laplace</i>. The first modern solution of general relativity that would characterize a black hole was found by <i class="person">Karl Schwarzschild</i> in 1916, although its interpretation as a region of space from which nothing can escape was first published by <i class="person">David Finkelstein</i> in 1958. Black holes were long considered a mathematical curiosity; it was during the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction of general relativity. The discovery of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star">neutron stars</a> sparked interest in gravitationally collapsed compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality.</p>
